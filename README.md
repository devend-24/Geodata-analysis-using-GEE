# 🌍 Land Cover Classification using Google Earth Engine

## 📊 Project Overview

This project utilizes Google Earth Engine (GEE) to perform land cover classification using Sentinel-2 imagery. The goal is to analyze and classify land cover types (e.g., 🌊 Water, 🌲 Forest, 🏙️ Urban) within a specified area.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- **Google Account** for GEE access
- **Google Colab** for running the code

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone or Upload the Notebook** to Google Colab.
2. **Install the Earth Engine API**:
   ```python
   !pip install earthengine-api
   ```
3. **Authenticate**:
   ```python
   import ee
   ee.Authenticate()
   ee.Initialize()
   ```
4. **Run the Analysis Code** to classify land cover!

## 📥 Export Results

Export the classified land cover data to your Google Drive in shapefile format! 🌐

## 💻 Example Code Snippet

```python
# Initialize and load the image collection
import ee
ee.Initialize()

# Your analysis code here...
```

## 🎉 Conclusion

This project showcases the power of remote sensing and machine learning for environmental monitoring. 🌱
